These classes need to be implemented:

  NamespaceEntry
  TypeContainer
  IIteratorContainer
  Block
  Parameters
  Expression
  Stack
  SourceFile

These are just classes for the parser, others may be implemented as necessary for 
actually compiling, and names may be changed as appropriate (just make sure the jay file 
gets updated as well).
